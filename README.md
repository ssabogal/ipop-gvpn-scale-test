# Scale-Test for IPOP

### Description

This project composes a set of scripts for automating the deployment and simulation of IPOP networks. Scale-Test supports both GroupVPN (using a structured peer-to-peer topology) and SocialVPN (using an unstructured, social topology),

### Usage

#### Preparing physical nodes (using CloudLab)

##### Pre-defined profiles

Use any of the following pre-defined profiles:

```
IPOP_SCALE_TEST_1_VIVID
IPOP_SCALE_TEST_2_VIVID
IPOP_SCALE_TEST_5_VIVID
```

##### Create a profile

Create a profile, with at least one node and each node containing the following properties:

* Node Type ```raw-pc```

* Hardware Type ```c220g2```

* Disk Image ```Other...``` with URN ```urn:publicid:IDN+emulab.net+image+emulab-ops:UBUNTU15-04-64-STD```

* Check the ```Publicly Routable IP``` option

##### Create an experiment

Note: ensure that the host's SSH keys are added to the CloudLab account.

Instantiate this profile as to create an experiment.

#### Using the automated test script

Open the ```List View``` tab to view the connections. Copy the connections (of the form ```<username>@<hostname>```) into ```scale/scale.cfg``` as ```NODE```, ```SERVER```, or ```FORWARDER```. Also specify the ```SIZE``` (the number of IPOP instances)

Optionally, specify the IPOP controller and tincan versions by assigning the ```CONTROLLER``` (commit/tag) and ```TINCAN``` (release version) fields in ```scale/scale.cfg```. When these fields are left unspecified, Scale-Test defaults to the latest release version.

For example, the following configuration has 1 node (assuming all roles) with 20 LXCs using version 16.01.1 of the IPOP controller and tincan:

```
NODE       ipopuser@c220g2-010618.wisc.cloudlab.us
SERVER     ipopuser@c220g2-010618.wisc.cloudlab.us
FORWARDER  ipopuser@c220g2-010618.wisc.cloudlab.us
SIZE       20

CONTROLLER v16.01.1
TINCAN     v16.01.1
```

Run the bash script:

```bash scale/scale.bash```

Enter the following commands:

```
download  # retrieves the IPOP sources specified by CONTROLLER and TINCAN or the defaults
accept    # enter 'yes' if prompted
install
init
source
config <gvpn | svpn> [options]
run all
```

#### Configuration

The ```config``` command supports user-configurable options for generating highly customized IPOP configurations.

+ For GroupVPN:

	```
	config gvpn <num_successors> <num_chords> <num_on_demand> <num_inbound> <ttl_link_initial> <ttl_link_pulse> <ttl_chord> <ttl_on_demand> <threshold_on_demand>
	```

	+ Example: ```config gvpn 2 3 2 8 60 30 180 60 128``` defines a GroupVPN topology with the follow characteristics:

		+ about 2 successors
		+ up to 3 chords
		+ up to 2 on-demand links
		+ about 8 in-bound links
		+ initializing links have a time-to-live of 60 seconds before they are trimmed
		+ established links have a time-to-live of 30 seconds before they are trimmed
		+ chords have a time-to-live of 180 seconds before they may be replaced
		+ on-demand links have a time-to-live of 60 seconds before they undergoes a threshold test
		+ on-demand links have a threshold of 128 transmitted bytes per second before they are trimmed

+ For SocialVPN:

	```
	config svpn
	```

	+ Example: ```config svpn``` defines a SocialVPN topology.


#### Using the visualizer:

Note: the visualizer depends on TKinter, use ```pacman -S tk``` (in Archlinux) or ```apt-get install python3-tk``` (in Ubuntu/Debian).

In scale.bash:

```
forward <forwarder port>
visualize <forwarder port> <gvpn | svpn>
```

### Other

#### Using the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

By default, Scale-Test only supports Ubuntu 15.04. To use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, modify ```scale/node/node.bash``` and set the variable ```NEW_TEST``` to ```false``` prior to deployment.

A reference profile with one physical-node and 20 LXC-nodes is available: ```IPOP_SCALE_TEST_1_TRUSTY```

#### Running IPOP with python3

By default, IPOP instances are ran with python2. To run IPOP with python3, modify ```scale/node/ipop/ipop.bash``` and set the variable ```PYTHON``` to ```python3``` prior to deployment.
